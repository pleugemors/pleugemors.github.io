"#The Why of Programming"
      There are many reasons that people would think of while joining the programming community.  Each individual has their own reason and certain experiences that help lead individuals to this career.  I am no different.  I first got a glimps of programming through my calculator that I used for math class.  It was fairly easy for me to learn how to program some of the simple formulas that we were using in our math class.  I did not take too much notice in my interest in that area.  Throughout high school, I did not know what I was going to do when I grow up.  I knew, however, that I happened to like science and math.  My dad was an engineer for a local plant so I thought that would be the best way to go while in college.
			
			I started my college career studying classes form electrical engineering.  I was caught completely clueless on how tough college was going to be.  I lasted approximately a year to a year and a half within the curriculum before I had to withdraw and re-evaluate what I was going to do.  The time spend at this college was not a complete loss.  I had a couple of classes that I truly liked.  One was a simple computers and how they work through assembly language.  Then there was a c++ class that I had to take later on.  I was not ready at this time to finish school and I took a hiatus.  In order to get better focus and determination within my life I decide to do something drastic.  I joined the United States military.
			
			Yes, I joined the United States Air Force to be exact.  I knew that it could do a couple of things for me.  It could one: pay for college and two: make me develop better discipline.  It did just that.  When I got out of the military, I was able to take a few classes and then I was able to get into Texas A&M's computer engineering curriculum.  I knew I liked the material, but I still was not exactly prepared for the program.  Having taken a lot of classes before being accepted to the major university forced me to take many project based classes together.  I could not keep up with the workload and make good grades.  I finally graduate, got a peice of paper that said i was smart.  Then I hit another snag, finding a job is and will be hard work.  No one would give me a chance because of my lower grades during college
			
			I am determined to get into the programming field.  This is yet another attempt at entering the field.  I know a lot of the information through the first two weeks of this program.  I know I have a lot to learn to catch up to where I need to be.  I know there will still be trying time in this program.  I think I am ready for it.  I know that I can adapt to the situation and appreciate the chance to do so.
